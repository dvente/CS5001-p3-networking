# CS5001-p3-networking
One project I did as an assignement for CS5001 (OOP) during my Masters at the University of St Andrews. 
It is a very simple HTTP server that can respond to GET, HEAD, and DELTE requests in text mode. 
This will not an ongoing project, it just serves as a reference for anyone who wants to see some of my work.
